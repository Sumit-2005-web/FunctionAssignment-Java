# FunctionAssignment.java

This is a simple Java program containing basic functions for practicing core programming concepts. It includes functions to calculate the average of three numbers, check if a number is even, and check if a number is a palindrome.

## Features

- **Average of Three Numbers**: Calculates and prints the average of three integers.
- **Even Number Check**: Checks whether a given number is even.
- **Palindrome Check**: Determines if a number is a palindrome.
- **Method Demonstration**: Contains a sample method to test the `isEven` method.

## File Structure

- `averageThreeNum(int a, int b, int c)`: Prints the average of three integers.
- `isEven(int n)`: Returns `true` if the number is even, `false` otherwise.
- `methodCheck()`: Calls `isEven()` with a sample value and prints the result.
- `isPalindrome(int n)`: Returns `true` if the number is a palindrome, `false` otherwise.
- `main(String[] args)`: Main method to test the functions.
